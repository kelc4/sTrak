# sTrak

This is an incomplete project from when I first started using react native. It was written on CodeHS.

It is an app to track stats for soccer games. It can currently take goals for and goals against, as well as the longest string of passes without getting interrupted, then get submitted. The game outcome then get added to overall stats of losses, ties and wins for the team. String of passes also gets displayed. Future developments include number of cards, who scored and who assisted the goal.
